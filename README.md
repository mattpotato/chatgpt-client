## Getting Started


First, install the dependencies using yarn or npm install, then run the development server:


```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
# then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

You'll also need to create an env.local file and add the following:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATGPT_TOKEN={your token from open ai}
```

Note that this will expose your chatgpt token in the frontend so it is only intended for personal use locally
